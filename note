minishell inside of minishell -> nothing works besides builtins
<< eof cat -> expand has issues when with quotes
export test="     la" -> echo "$test" many issues on valgrind
export test="echo     $PATH" (or any text after the echo) -> command not found
free_exit after dup
errors handling on cd
if heredoc file is deleted during heredoc, have better error display
env -i (removed env) does not display command not found
"$WDAWDW" or "" or '' doesnt display command not foudn 
unset removes every variable above target and target
<< "$PATH" cat doesnt stop the heredoc when $PATH is given, the limiter is expanded when it shouldnt
unset home -> cd should print an error but it doesnt
env should always go through your builtin, not execve if more than 1 arg
echo - "" "" "" hello doesnt print the new line
cd .. hi - > error has 2 \n
heredocs should always go first, cat << eof | ls does ls at the same time as the heredoc
cat | ls -> ctrl c prints ^C but without a newline at the end
