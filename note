FIXED: minishell inside of minishell -> nothing works besides builtins
FIXED: export test="     la" -> echo "$test" many issues on valgrind
FIXED: export test="echo     $PATH" (or any text after the echo) -> command not found
FIXED: free_exit after dup
FIXED: errors handling on cd
FIXED: if heredoc file is deleted during heredoc, have better error display
FIXED: env -i (removed env) does not display command not found
FIXED: unset home -> cd should print an error but it doesnt
FIXED: env should always go through your builtin, not execve if more than 1 arg
FIXED: echo - "" "" "" hello doesnt print the new line
FIXED: cd .. hi - > error has 2 \n
FIXED: cat | ls -> ctrl c prints ^C but without a newline at the end
FIXED: "$WDAWDW" or "" or '' doesnt display command not found

<< eof cat -> expand has issues when with quotes
<< "$PATH" cat doesnt stop the heredoc when $PATH is given, the limiter is expanded when it shouldn't
heredocs should always go first, cat << eof | ls does ls at the same time as the heredoc
